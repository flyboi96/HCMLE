# Day 4: Human-Centered Design – AI Recommender System

## 1. Product Overview
An AI-powered movie/content recommender suggests shows or films based on a user’s watch history, preferences, or demographics. Examples include Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify. These systems aim to maximize engagement but often lack transparency or meaningful user control.

## 2. User Needs & Design Ideas

| **User Need** | **Design Response** |
|---------------|----------------------|
| I want to understand *why* this was recommended | Display a short explanation ("Recommended because you liked X") with an option to view more |
| I want control over what influences my recommendations | Add user-adjustable sliders or toggles for genre, mood, recency, or preferred language |
| I want to discover something *new*, not just similar content | Include a “Surprise Me” or “Serendipity Mode” that intentionally surfaces diverse recommendations |
| I don’t want to feel surveilled or tracked | Let users opt out of sensitive personalization categories and explain data use clearly |
| I want to refine my recommendations | Provide a feedback mechanism like “More Like This” / “Less Like This” or skip/dislike options |
| I need accessibility options in content (e.g., subtitles, dubbing) | Let users filter content by availability of accessibility features and save preferences |

## 3. Reflection Note
Designing human-centered AI recommenders requires balancing utility with **user agency, trust, and diversity**. A system that only optimizes for engagement risks creating echo chambers or discomfort. By surfacing *why* content is recommended and allowing users to shape their profile, we support not just personalization, but empowerment. This shifts the system from **opaque prediction to collaborative discovery**.
