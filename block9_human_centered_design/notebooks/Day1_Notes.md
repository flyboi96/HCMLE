# Day 1: Introduce UX and human design principles

### UI vs UX
- UI (User Interface) is what the user sees and interacts with - buttons, colors, layout, typography
- UX (User Experience) is how the user feels about using the product - ease of use, clarity, satisfaction, and overall usability

### Stages of UI Design
- Define and Research: Identify target users, clarify project goals, conduct competitor analysis, and outline information architecture.
- Design: Build wireframes, apply visual styles, and create interactive prototypes.
- Test: Conduct usability testing, gather feedback, and iterate on design decisions.

### Stages of UX Design
- Research: Empathize with users, define the problem, analyze data, and synthesize insights.
- Prototype: Ideate potential solutions, create prototypes, test, and refine ideas.
- Analyze and Iterate: Evaluate user feedback, refine interactions, and improve the design continuously.

### Atomic Design Principle
- Atoms => Molecules => Organisms => Templates => Pages
- Subatomic particles: Foundational design tokens like color palettes or type scales.
- Atoms: Basic UI components (e.g., button, input field, label).
- Molecules: Small functional groups (e.g., labeled form field).
- Organisms: Complex UI sections composed of molecules (e.g., a header).
- Templates: Page-level structure for layout and content positioning.
- Pages: Final rendered screens with real content, ready for use or testing.

## Don Norman's "Design of Everyday Things" Chapter 1 - The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

Chapter 1 explores why many everyday objects are frustrating to use and how good design can eliminate confusion and error. Key takeaways include:

- **Affordances**: The perceived and actual properties of an object that suggest how it should be used (e.g., a handle “affords” pulling).
- **Signifiers**: Visual cues that indicate where action should take place (e.g., a button labeled “Push”).
- **Mappings**: The relationship between controls and their effects (e.g., stove knobs that don't clearly match burners are poor mappings).
- **Feedback**: Immediate and informative response to user actions (e.g., a beep or light when pressing a button).
- **Conceptual Models**: Users form mental models based on how things appear; inconsistent or misleading models lead to errors.

> Poor design isn't the user's fault. It's the result of systems that ignore human psychology.

These principles reinforce the importance of **clarity, consistency, and user-centered thinking**—which directly apply to interface design for machine learning tools and AI-driven experiences.
