# Block 9: Human-Centered Design

## Overview
This block focuses on the fundamentals of Human-Centered Design (HCD) and User Experience (UX) design principles. The objective is to develop a user-first mindset essential for building AI/ML systems that are ethical, accessible, and meaningful. Through structured video tutorials, hands-on exercises, and critical reflections, this block builds foundational understanding of the design thinking process and its application to both traditional and AI-driven products.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the user-centered design cycle: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test
- Define and apply key UX concepts such as empathy, personas, usability, and iterative design
- Conduct critical analysis of everyday products and identify design improvements
- Translate user needs into concrete features and design decisions for AI products
- Build simple prototypes and evaluate their usability
- Reflect on how HCD principles can be integrated into ML development workflows

## Weekly Highlights
- Completed major segments of Intellipaat's 11-hour *UI/UX Design Full Course* (YouTube)
- Conducted a usability critique of a real-world product using design thinking methods
- Proposed user-centered design features for an AI recommendation system
- Created a simple prototype and evaluated it using basic UX testing principles
- Reflected on how to consistently integrate user needs into ML product design

## Key Deliverables
- `block9_schedule.md`: 8-day plan covering daily objectives, tasks, and deliverables
- Definitions and notes from Intellipaat video course
- Chapter 1 highlights and insights from *The Design of Everyday Things* by Don Norman
- Design critique: usability issues and improvement suggestions for an everyday product
- Design proposal for a human-centered AI product
- Prototype and user flow diagram with written rationale
- Usability evaluation write-up
- Final reflection on the role of HCD in machine learning

## Supporting Files
- Notebooks and markdown files: see `notebooks/` for structured notes and exercises
- Diagrams and prototypes: stored in `plots/` or embedded in markdown where applicable

## Reflections
This block deepened my appreciation for the value of empathy and usability in product development. I learned to shift from a model-first mindset to a user-first mindset—one that starts with real user needs and works backward toward technical implementation. These principles, reinforced by Norman’s work and applied through guided UX training, are foundational to my broader goal of becoming a Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer.
