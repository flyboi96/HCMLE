# Block 7: Deep Learning for Tabular Data

## Overview
This block explores how deep learning techniques can be applied to structured/tabular datasets using the `fastai` library. You will build, train, and interpret a neural network on a real-world tabular dataset, with an emphasis on preprocessing, model explainability, and comparison to classical ML methods.

---

## Objectives
- Learn how `TabularLearner` works in fastai
- Handle categorical and continuous variables effectively
- Apply data preprocessing (normalization, embeddings)
- Train and evaluate a tabular deep learning model
- Analyze feature importance for interpretability
- Reflect on differences between deep learning and classical ML
