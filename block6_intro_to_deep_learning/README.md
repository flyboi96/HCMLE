# Block 6: Introduction to Deep Learning

## Overview

In this block, we explore the foundations of deep learning, beginning with a hands-on project using the fast.ai library. The focus is on training and interpreting a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images, gaining intuition about neural network architecture, and understanding how deep learning differs from traditional machine learning.

## Goals

- Understand what neural networks are and how they work
- Learn the basic structure of deep learning models (layers, activations, loss)
- Train and evaluate an image classifier using fast.ai Lesson 1
- Experiment with hyperparameters and datasets
- Communicate deep learning results in a human-centered, explainable way

## Tools and Resources

- `fast.ai` Lesson 1 (2022 edition)
- Optional: Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Google Colab with GPU (recommended)
- Jupyter Notebooks (locally via VSCode or Colab)
