## 1. Objective
To explain core components of deep learning in simple terms:
- Neural networks
- Layers
- Activations
- Epochs
- Loss functions

## 2. Key Concepts (in plain English)

### What is a Neural Network?
A **neural network** is a kind of computer program designed to recognize patterns. Instead of writing detailed instructions, we give it examples, and it learns from them. It’s loosely inspired by the way the brain works.

At its core, a neural network is made of many tiny decision-making units (called "neurons") that are arranged in layers. Each one passes its output to the next layer until a final answer (like "cat" or "dog") is produced.

### What is a Layer?
A **layer** is a group of neurons working at the same stage of decision-making. Think of each layer as a step in a multi-step reasoning process. The input layer takes in raw data (like pixels of an image), the hidden layers do the reasoning, and the output layer gives the final prediction.

### What is an Activation Function?
An **activation function** is a small mathematical operation each neuron uses to decide what signal to pass forward. It helps the network learn complicated things by adding flexibility. Without activation functions, neural networks would only be able to learn very simple relationships.

### What is an Epoch?
An **epoch** is one full pass through the entire training dataset. If you have 1,000 images and train for 5 epochs, your model will have seen each image 5 times. Each pass helps the model learn and adjust to do better.

### What is a Loss Function?
The **loss function** is a way of measuring how wrong the model’s predictions are. If your model predicts “cat” when it was really a “dog,” the loss will be high. The model uses this feedback to adjust itself and improve next time.

## 3. Summary of Model Architecture (in plain English)
- You start with a set of labeled examples (like pictures of cats and dogs).
- You pick a **model architecture** (a predefined structure, such as ResNet34) that knows how to process images.
- A pretrained version of this model has already learned to recognize many things.
- You **fine-tune** it on your own images, so it adjusts to recognize cats vs. dogs specifically.
- The model goes through multiple **epochs** to get better.
- During training, it calculates **loss**, then tweaks its internal values (called **weights**) to reduce that loss.
- After training, it can take new images and make good predictions.
