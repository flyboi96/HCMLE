    "This sample of 10 validation images shows the model's predicted label, true label, and its confidence level for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Summary:\n",
    "- **100% accuracy** on this sample: all 10 predictions match the true labels.\n",
    "- Every prediction was made with **100% confidence**, suggesting the model is highly certain on held-out MNIST digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observed Patterns:\n",
    "- The model handles both upright and slightly stylized digits (e.g., curled 3s, slanted 7s) with ease.\n",
    "- It is robust to minor thickness and curvature variations in both classes.\n",
    "- 7s with shallow crossbars and 3s with tighter top loops were still correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Human-Centered Perspective:\n",
    "This level of performance suggests the model is highly reliable on digits formatted similarly to the training set (i.e., MNIST-style). For production use with user-drawn sketches, we should still test against out-of-distribution examples â€” especially thinner strokes, rotated digits, or digits written with non-standard curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- All predictions were visually consistent with their true class.\n",
    "- Sample balance: 5 images of each class, randomly selected."
