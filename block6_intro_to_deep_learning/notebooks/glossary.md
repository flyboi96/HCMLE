## Neural Network
A computer system inspired by the brain that learns from examples. It’s made up of connected layers of artificial “neurons” that pass information through mathematical operations to make predictions.

## Layer
A stage in a neural network made up of multiple neurons. Each layer transforms its input and passes the result to the next layer.

## Activation Function
A small mathematical function that helps each neuron decide what signal to pass forward. It introduces non-linearity, allowing the model to learn complex patterns.

## Epoch
One complete pass through the entire training dataset. Neural networks often train over multiple epochs to improve performance.

## Loss Function
A measure of how wrong the model’s predictions are. Lower loss means the model is performing better. The model uses this value to improve during training.

## Architecture
The design of the neural network — including the number of layers, type of layers, and how they are connected. Common architectures include ResNet, CNN, and RNN.

## Fine-Tuning
Adapting a pretrained model to a new task by training it further on new data. This saves time and often leads to better results with less data.

## Weights
The internal parameters of a neural network that adjust during training to help the model make better predictions.
