# Block 8: Data Visualization & Communication

## Objective

Develop the ability to communicate data and model results effectively through clear, purposeful visualizations. This block focuses on designing plots that help technical and non-technical stakeholders understand and trust the insights derived from machine learning workflows.

## Key Resources

- Kaggle Learn: Data Visualization (Python, seaborn/matplotlib)
- “Storytelling with Data” by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic – Ch. 2 & 3
- (Optional) Tableau Public or Google Data Studio
- (Optional) IBM Data Visualization Guide
