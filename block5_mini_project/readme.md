# 🧪 Block 5: Mini Project 1 – Gallstone Disease Prediction

This repository contains the work completed during Block 5 of the HCMLE learning roadmap. The goal of this block was to conduct an end-to-end machine learning project that applies concepts learned in previous blocks and produces a human-centered, interpretable solution. The project focuses on predicting gallstone disease based on demographic, laboratory, and bioimpedance data.

## 📌 Project Summary

**Project Title:** Predicting Gallstone Disease from Non-Imaging Data  
**Dataset:** [Gallstone Dataset – UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1150/gallstone-1)  
**Source Paper:** Esen et al. (2024) – DOI: [10.1097/md.0000000000037258](https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000037258)

**Problem:**  
Diagnosing gallstones typically requires imaging, which is costly and resource-intensive. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning classifier that uses accessible, non-imaging data to predict whether a patient is likely to have gallstone disease.

**Stakeholder:**  
Internal medicine physicians and general practitioners who must triage patients for further imaging.
