    "- **Body composition variables** are mostly normal or mildly skewed — ideal for modeling.\n",
    "- `obesity_percent` originally contained 18 implausible outliers (e.g., values up to 1954%), likely due to device mis-scaling or raw fat/weight ratio reporting. These were **capped at 70%** — a biologically plausible upper limit — and **flagged with a new column `obesity_outlier_flag`**. The updated distribution is now realistic and suitable for inclusion in modeling pipelines.\n",

    "### Implications for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Redundancy:** Many features are biologically or structurally linked (e.g., TBW/ICW/ECW, muscle mass and water content). Including all in a model could lead to multicollinearity and overfitting — especially in linear models or models sensitive to correlated predictors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction Candidates:** Strongly correlated feature groups could benefit from:\n",
    "  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "  - Domain-driven feature selection (e.g., keep only `muscle_mass_kg` from the muscle/water group)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Biological Validation:** The correlation structure is consistent with physiology and device-derived measurement logic. For instance:\n",
    "  - Water and lean tissue variables track together\n",
    "  - Fat ratio and lean ratio are nearly perfect inverses\n",
    "  - BMI is central to both muscle and fat metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Robustness Considerations:** \n",
    "  - For **tree-based models**, high collinearity is less problematic due to feature splitting behavior.\n",
    "  - For **linear models or logistic regression**, regularization or variance inflation factor (VIF) assessment may be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider **dropping or consolidating** features within highly correlated clusters.\n",
    "- If interpretability is critical, favor **clinically interpretable representatives** (e.g., retain `bmi`, drop `obesity_percent`).\n",
    "- For exploratory models, **retain all features** and evaluate downstream model coefficients or feature importances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This correlation analysis provides foundational insight into the structure of the dataset and helps avoid redundancy, instability, or overfitting in future modeling pipelines."
