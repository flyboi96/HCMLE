# 📌 Notes – Success Criteria from PAIR Guidebook: "Defining Success"

These notes summarize key takeaways from the "Defining Success" chapter of the People + AI Guidebook, tailored to support the Gallstone Disease Prediction project.

### 🔍 1. Success is human-centered, not just model-centered.
- A high-performing model is not enough — it must solve a real user problem in a helpful and responsible way.
- In this project, success means supporting physicians in early triage without replacing clinical judgment.

### 📈 2. Define success metrics based on user impact.
- Choose evaluation metrics (e.g., recall, AUC) that reflect what matters most to users.
- For this medical context, minimizing false negatives (high recall) is crucial — missing a gallstone case is more dangerous than a false alarm.

### 🧭 3. Align ML goals with broader workflow goals.
- Success should be measured by the model's utility in a clinical setting, not just test-set accuracy.
- A successful model integrates with existing practices (e.g., flagging patients who may need imaging) without disrupting clinician workflows.

### 🤝 4. Stakeholders may have different definitions of success.
- Physicians, hospital admins, and patients may value different aspects (speed, interpretability, cost reduction).
- This project considers physician utility and patient benefit as primary.

### 🪞 5. Make room for iteration.
- Success criteria may evolve — keep evaluating how well the system meets real user needs as insights develop.
