# Block 5: Mini Project 1 – Project Schedule

This schedule outlines the 8-day plan for completing your end-to-end ML project along with readings that support human-centered design and storytelling.

---

## Day 1 – Define the Project
**Objective:** Define the end-to-end ML project’s scope, success criteria, and planning roadmap.
**Tasks:**
- Choose a beginner-friendly dataset from Kaggle or similar
- Create folder structure (`data/`, `notebooks/`, `models/`, `reports/`, `plots/`)
- Write `project_proposal.md` with: problem, stakeholder, success criteria, why it matters
- Read Google PAIR: *User Needs + Defining Success*
- Create and save `project_schedule.md`

**Deliverables:**
- `project_proposal.md`
- `project_schedule.md`
- `notes_success_criteria.md` with PAIR takeaways

---

## Day 2 – Data Cleaning
**Objective:** Prepare your data for analysis.
**Tasks:**
- Load dataset into `day2_data_cleaning.ipynb`
- Handle missing values and data types
- Flag any user-affecting issues (leakage, bias, fairness)
- Save cleaned data as `cleaned.csv`
- Read PAIR chapter: *Mental Models*

**Deliverables:**
- `cleaned.csv`
- Notebook with notes and code
- Commentary on any usability or fairness issues

---

## Day 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis
**Objective:** Understand your data visually and statistically.
**Tasks:**
- Create `day3_eda.ipynb`
- Plot target distribution, feature relationships, correlations
- Save top plots in `plots/`
- Read: *Storytelling with Data* – Chapter 2: Choosing an Effective Visual

**Deliverables:**
- EDA notebook
- 2–3 labeled visualizations
- Markdown summary of findings

---

## Day 4 – Modeling (Baseline & Model 2)
**Objective:** Train two models and begin comparison.
**Tasks:**
- Create `day4_modeling.ipynb`
- Train baseline model (e.g., logistic or linear regression)
- Train second model (e.g., Random Forest or Gradient Boosting)
- Save both models in `models/`
- Read PAIR: *Explainability + Trust*

**Deliverables:**
- Saved models
- Notebook with rationale and performance metrics
- Notes on interpretability vs. performance

---

## Day 5 – Model Evaluation
**Objective:** Evaluate models using performance metrics and compare trade-offs.
**Tasks:**
- Create `day5_model_eval.ipynb`
- Use cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC/PR, MAE/RMSE as appropriate
- Consider real-world implications of error types
- Read: *Storytelling with Data* – Chapter 3: Clutter is Your Enemy

**Deliverables:**
- Clean, metric-rich evaluation notebook
- Comparison table or chart
- Markdown: Which model best meets user needs?

---

## Day 6 – Interpretability
**Objective:** Make model decisions explainable and relatable.
**Tasks:**
- Create `day6_interpretability.ipynb`
- Use SHAP, permutation importance, or feature importance
- Visualize and explain top 5 features
- Read: *Storytelling with Data* – Chapter 4: Focus Your Audience’s Attention

**Deliverables:**
- Clear interpretation notebook
- Visuals with explanations
- Summary for stakeholders

---

## Day 7 – Polish & Model Card
**Objective:** Finalize your notebook and create transparent documentation.
**Tasks:**
- Create final project notebook `final_project.ipynb`: polished intro → EDA → models → eval → conclusion
- Save as HTML
- Write `model_card.md`: model summary, training data, metrics, risks
- Read: *Storytelling with Data* – Chapter 1 (Importance of Context)

**Deliverables:**
- Final clean notebook
- HTML report
- Model card

---

## Day 8 – Share & Reflect
**Objective:** Write a summary and finalize the GitHub repo.
**Tasks:**
- Draft `blog_draft.md` with lessons learned and story arc
- Push all work to GitHub
- Add `block5_complete` tag and GitHub release
- Write `reflection_notes.md`
- Read: *Storytelling with Data* – Chapters 7 (Lessons in Storytelling) + 8 (Pulling It All Together)

**Deliverables:**
- Blog-style write-up
- Final GitHub commit + tag + release
- Final reflections
