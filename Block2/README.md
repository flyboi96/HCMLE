# 📊 Block 2: Data Manipulation with Pandas

This block is focused on building fluency with **Pandas** and **NumPy** to explore, clean, and transform data effectively — all foundational skills for a Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer.

You’ll learn to think in terms of **Series and DataFrames**, use Pandas’ powerful filtering and grouping tools, and apply real exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover meaningful patterns.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand Pandas Series and DataFrame structures
- Apply slicing, indexing, and logical filtering with confidence
- Use `.groupby()`, `.agg()`, and transformations to summarize data
- Create new columns, handle missing values, and clean datasets
- Begin basic EDA through plotting and pattern discovery
