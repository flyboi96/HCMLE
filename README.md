# 🧠 Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer (HCMLE)

This is a curated, self-directed journey toward becoming a **Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer** — a role at the intersection of data science, human factors, and responsible AI. The focus is on developing robust technical skills *and* human-centered intuition for building ML systems that are usable, interpretable, and ethically sound.

This repository is structured into focused learning "blocks," each with Jupyter notebooks, hands-on projects, and curated readings. The goal is to build deep technical understanding *and* the human-centered thinking needed to design useful, ethical, and interpretable ML systems.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

To run this project locally with **Jupyter + Conda + VS Code**:

### 🔧 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyboi96/HCMLE.git
cd HCMLE
```

### 🧪 2. Create and activate the environment

Make sure you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hcmle-env
```

### 💻 3. Open in VS Code

To launch the project with the correct kernel, folders, and settings:

```bash
code HCMLE.code-workspace
```

> Make sure you have the Python and Jupyter extensions installed in VS Code.

### 🧹 4. Optional: Clean and update the environment

If you add new packages:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

To export your environment:

```bash
conda env export --from-history > environment.yml
```
