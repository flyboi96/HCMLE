# 🔍 Block 4: Intermediate Machine Learning & Model Improvement

Welcome to Block 4 of my Human-Centered Machine Learning Engineer (HCMLE) learning journey.  
This stage focuses on developing robust, real-world ML workflows by improving model performance and handling common data challenges.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Handle missing data and categorical variables using pipelines
- Understand and apply decision trees and ensemble models (e.g., Random Forests)
- Engineer features to improve model expressiveness
- Evaluate models using robust metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Tune model performance using cross-validation and hyperparameter search
- Compare baseline and improved models through structured analysis
