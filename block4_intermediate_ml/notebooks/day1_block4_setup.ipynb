    "\n",
    "- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** **$2,621.79 AUD**\n",
    "- **R² Score:** 0.592\n",
    "\n",
    "This Decision Tree Regressor was built using default hyperparameters and trained on a preprocessed dataset with only numerical features and no imputation, encoding, or scaling. The lack of robustness in handling missing values and categorical information means this result is unlikely to generalize well to real-world data pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Lessons & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overfitting risk:** Decision Trees are prone to high variance without depth constraints or ensemble averaging.\n",
    "- **No pipeline used:** Preprocessing steps (dropping NaNs, filtering numerics) were not encapsulated in a reproducible structure.\n",
    "- **Categoricals ignored:** Location-based insights (e.g., `Suburb`, `CouncilArea`) were excluded, missing key predictive signals.\n",
    "- **No cross-validation:** Only a single test split was used, which limits confidence in performance reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Block 4 Goals (Building from Here)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate robust preprocessing using `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer`\n",
    "- Handle missing values with appropriate imputation strategies\n",
    "- Include and encode categorical variables\n",
    "- Introduce ensemble learning with `RandomForestRegressor`\n",
    "- Evaluate via cross-validation and multiple metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)\n",
    "- Track performance improvements in a structured comparison report\n",
